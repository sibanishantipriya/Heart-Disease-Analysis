## Introduction
Heart disease is a significant health concern worldwide. Analyzing heart disease data can provide valuable insights into factors affecting heart health. This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis on heart disease data using Python.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python (3.6+)
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib <br>
You can install these libraries using pip:
*pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib*

## Data Source
The data used in this analysis can be obtained from [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: <br>
git clone https://github.com/satyaprakash2002/Heart-Disease-Analysis.git
1. Change directory:
cd Heart-Disease-Analysis
1. You can either download the dataset from the provided source link or use your own data. Place the data file in the project directory.

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to analyze the heart disease data.

## Analysis
- Data Loading: Load the heart disease dataset.
- Data Exploration: Examine the dataset's structure, data types, and basic statistics.
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and preprocess the data if necessary.
- Data Visualization: Create visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to explore patterns and relationships in the data.
- Feature Analysis: Examine the significance of different features in relation to heart disease.
- Model Building (if applicable): Build and evaluate predictive models to detect heart disease.
